# CODING-SAMURAI-INTERNSHIP-TASK
Task 2 submission for the Coding Samurai AI internship

In this project, our objective is to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch for the specific task of classifying handwritten digits. CNNs are especially effective in handling image data, making them ideal for this type of classification task. The CNN architecture will be tailored to effectively recognize and classify the diverse handwritten digits within the MNIST dataset.

The MNIST dataset is a widely used collection of handwritten digits, frequently utilized in machine learning and computer vision research. It consists of a vast set of 28x28 pixel grayscale images, each representing a single handwritten digit (0 through 9). MNIST provides a total of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples, making it a standard benchmark for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly those related to image classification and digit recognition. Due to its simplicity and accessibility, the MNIST dataset has become a foundational dataset for developing and validating various machine learning algorithms and models.

This project leverages Google Colab notebooks, a cloud-based interactive computing environment, for developing and executing the neural network model. Google Colab provides a free, GPU-accelerated platform that facilitates collaborative coding, data analysis, and machine learning tasks. This allows for seamless implementation and experimentation with the neural network architecture to classify handwritten digits using PyTorch and CNN. The advantages of using Google Colab include access to powerful computing resources, a variety of pre-installed libraries, and the ability to easily share and collaborate on the project with team members.
